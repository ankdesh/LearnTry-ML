Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the \"Year of Intelligence\", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission.

First came the revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 of the US Army\\'s spying on the civilian population and Senator Sam Ervin\\'s Senate investigations produced more revelations. Then on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the \"family jewels\". Covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.The creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee', 'summary': 'The Church Committee (formally the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities) was a US Senate select committee in 1975 that  investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
