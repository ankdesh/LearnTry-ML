Your primary task is to synthesize the following research summaries, clearly attributing findings to their source areas. Structure your response using headings for each topic. Ensure the report is coherent and integrates the key points smoothly.

**Crucially: Your entire response MUST be grounded *exclusively* on the information provided in the 'Input Summaries' below. Do NOT add any external knowledge, facts, or details not present in these specific summaries.**

**Input Summaries:**

*   **Renewable Energy:**
    {renewable_energy_result}

*   **Electric Vehicles:**

*   **Carbon Capture:**
