# STOP!

**Please don't waste my time!**

Most of the problems people are having are already described in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/README.md).

You should first make a serious attempt to solve your problem.
If you ask a question that has already been answered elsewhere, or if you do not
give enough details about your problem, then your issue may be closed immediately. 

## Python 3

These tutorials were developed in **Python 3.5** (and higher) and may give strange errors in Python 2.7

## Missing Files

You need to **download the whole repository**, either using `git clone` or as a zip-file. See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/README.md).

## Questions about TensorFlow

General questions about TensorFlow should either be asked on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow) or the [official TensorFlow repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues).

## Modifications

Questions about modifications or how to use these tutorials on your own data-set should also be asked on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow).

Thousands of people are using these tutorials. It is impossible for me to give individual support for your project.

## Suggestions for Changes

The tutorials cannot change too much because it would make the [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Hr9sNUjfsmEu1ZniY0XpHSzl5uihcXZ) too different from the source-code.

## Requests for New Tutorials

These tutorials were made by a single person on his own time. It took a very long time to
research and produce the tutorials. If a topic is not covered then the best thing is to make
a new tutorial by yourself. All you need is a decent microphone, a screen-grabbing tool, and a
video editor. I used the free version of [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).

## Other Issues?

Please carefully read the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/README.md) and only open an issue if you are still having problems.
