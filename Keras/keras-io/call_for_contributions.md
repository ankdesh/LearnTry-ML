## Improve next-frame prediction with ConvLSTM

[Current example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/conv_lstm/)

Recommendations:

- Find a better, more interesting dataset
- Make it work better
- Add detailed explanations

## Large-scale multi-label text classification

Using word bi-grams + TF-IDF + a small MLP, from raw text strings.
The tokenization and extraction of TF-IDF ngrams should be done with the `TextVectorization` layer.

The dataset should have at least 50k samples and there should be at least a dozen of labels.
