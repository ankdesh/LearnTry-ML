Welcome to the Zero to Deep Learning Video Course repository

## Get started guide

#### Clone this repository on your local computer

```
git clone https://github.com/Dataweekends/zero_to_deep_learning_udemy.git
```

#### Download and Install Anaconda Python 3.6

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

#### Change to course folder

```
cd zero_to_deep_learning_udemy
```

#### Create the course environment

```
conda env create
```

wait for the environment to create.

#### Activate the environment (Mac/Linux)
```
source activate ztdl
```

#### Activate the environment (Windows)

#### Troubleshooting installation
If for some reason you don't see `Houston we are go!`, the simplest solution is to delete the environment and start from scratch again.

To remove the environment:

- close the browser and go back to your terminal
- stop jupyter notebook (CTRL-C)
- deactivate the environment (Mac/Linux):

```
source deactivate
```

- deactivate the environment (Windows 10):

```
deactivate ztdl
```

- delete the environment:

```
conda remove -y -n ztdl --all
```

- restart from environment creation and make sure that each steps completes till the end.

#### Updating Conda

One thing you can also try is to update your conda executable. This may help if you already had Anaconda installed on your system.
